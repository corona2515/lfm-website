## Part 1: Grand Slam Offer Framework

### The Value Equation
**Value = (Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay x Effort & Sacrifice)**

Our job: Maximize the top, minimize the bottom.

---

### Dream Outcome (What They REALLY Want)

Building owners don't want "fault detection." They want:

1. **Money back in their pocket** - Every dollar saved on energy goes straight to NOI
2. **Peace of mind** - Know their buildings aren't bleeding cash while they sleep
3. **Credibility with stakeholders** - Prove they're good stewards of the asset
4. **Competitive advantage** - Better-performing buildings attract better tenants
5. **Time freedom** - Stop firefighting equipment failures

**The Ultimate Dream Statement:**
> "Wake up knowing exactly which building issues are costing you money, with a prioritized punch list to fix them—without hiring consultants, installing sensors, or learning complex software."

---

### Perceived Likelihood of Achievement

**Why would they believe OnPoint works?**

| Doubt | Likelihood Booster |
|-------|-------------------|
| "AI tools overpromise" | Prescriptiv is built on proven fault detection algorithms, not experimental AI |
| "My buildings are different" | Works with any BAS that exports CSV—we've processed 3M+ data points |
| "I've tried tools before" | Free preview proves value before you pay a dime |
| "My data is messy" | Guided mapping handles any naming convention |
| "Results will be confusing" | Prioritized by severity with plain-English recommendations |

**Social Proof Stacking:**
- "Processed 3M+ data points"
- Industry-specific case studies (K-12, Museums, Higher Ed)
- "Guided onboarding with prioritized findings" (aligned with current rollout)

---

### Onboarding Model (Current)

**Old Way (Enterprise AFDD):**
- 3-6 months procurement
- 4-8 weeks installation
- 2-4 weeks calibration
- Ongoing consultant dependency
- **Total: long implementation before usable guidance**

**OnPoint Way:**
- Submit lead form for guided onboarding or create account
- Upload BAS sample data (your export or template)
- Receive prioritized findings and recommended next steps
- **Total: timeline varies based on data quality and onboarding volume**

**Messaging Focus:**
- "Start with sample data and validate value before committing"
- "No long-term contract required to start"
- "Clear priorities for what to fix first"

---

### Effort & Sacrifice (Make It Easy)

**What We Eliminate:**
| Traditional Pain | OnPoint Solution |
|-----------------|------------------|
| RFP process | Just upload a file |
| Sensor installation | Use your existing BAS data |
| Software training | Guided interface, no training |
| IT involvement | Cloud-based, nothing to install |
| Consultant dependency | Self-service with clear recommendations |
| Long-term contracts | Free preview, pay-as-you-go, cancel anytime |

**Effort Messaging:**
- "No sensors. No installation. No training."
- "If you can export a CSV, you can use OnPoint"
- "Your facilities team can run this without IT"

---

## Part 2: Value Stack by Tier

### Tier 1: FREE (Preview) - The Taste

**Core Deliverable:**
- Upload one BAS data file
- Map up to 100 data points
- Preview top 5 detected faults with severity
- Sample recommended actions

**Psychological Purpose:**
The free tier exists to create an "aha moment" that makes NOT paying feel like leaving money on the table.

**Value Perception Tactics:**
1. Show the TOTAL faults detected, but only reveal top 5
2. Display estimated impact categories (High/Medium/Low) for hidden faults
3. Show blurred/locked full report to visualize what they're missing

**Copy for Free Tier:**
> "See what's hiding in your building data. Free. No credit card."

**What They CAN'T Do (Creates Desire):**
- See full fault list (gated after 5)
- Access detailed action recommendations
- Export any data
- Upload additional files
- Access historical results

---

### Tier 2: UNLOCK (One-Time) - The Reveal

**Core Deliverable:**
- Full results for uploaded dataset
- All detected faults with severity ranking
- Complete recommended actions with priority order
- Export to PDF/CSV
- 30-day access to results

**Pricing Structure:**
- Small dataset (<500 points): $199
- Medium dataset (500-2,000 points): $399
- Large dataset (2,000+ points): $599

**Bonuses (Value Stack):**

| Bonus | Value Anchor |
|-------|-------------|
| Priority Action Matrix | "Which consultants charge $5,000+ to create" |
| Estimated Impact Assessment | "See potential savings ranked by severity" |
| Executive Summary PDF | "Board-ready report in one click" |
| 30-Day Access | "Revisit as you work through fixes" |

**Risk Reversal:**
> "Found nothing actionable? Email us within 7 days for a full refund. We only win when you find real issues."

**Price Anchoring:**
> "One energy audit costs $15,000-50,000 and takes 3 months. OnPoint delivers guided fault detection onboarding for less than a service call."

**Urgency Element:**
> "Your preview results expire in 7 days. Unlock now to save your analysis."

---

### Tier 3: SUBSCRIBE (Continuous) - The Transformation

**Core Deliverable:**
- Unlimited uploads
- Continuous monitoring capability
- Automated reporting (weekly/monthly)
- Priority support

- Professional (6-20 buildings): $599/mo or $5,999/yr (save 2 months)
- Enterprise (20+ buildings): Custom pricing

**Bonuses (Value Stack):**

| Bonus | Value Anchor |
|-------|-------------|
| Portfolio-Wide Prioritization | "See worst issues across ALL buildings" |
| Automated Monthly Reports | "Auto-generate board reports" |
| Trend Tracking | "Prove your fixes worked" |
| Team Collaboration | "Assign issues, track completion" |

**For Annual:**
> "Commit to the year, get 2 months free. That's $600+ back in your pocket."

**Price Anchoring:**
> "Traditional AFDD systems cost $50,000+ to implement. OnPoint delivers continuous monitoring for less than your monthly landscaping bill."

---

## Part 3: Objection Destruction

### Top 10 Objections with Killer Responses

---

**Objection 1: "We already have a BAS. Why do we need this?"**

**Response Copy:**
> Your BAS shows you what's happening. OnPoint shows you what's WRONG, WHY it matters, and exactly WHAT to do about it—prioritized so you fix the $10,000 problem before the $100 one.
>
> Think of it this way: Your BAS is the dashboard. OnPoint is the mechanic who tells you what's actually broken.

---

**Objection 2: "We tried fault detection before and it was a nightmare."**

**Response Copy:**
> We hear this constantly. Traditional AFDD requires sensors, installation, calibration, and an army of consultants just to get started.
>
> We rebuilt OnPoint specifically for teams who were burned by "enterprise" solutions. Upload a CSV, map your points, get results. That's it. No installation. No consultants. No 6-month implementation.
>
> Don't take our word for it—start with a free preview and review prioritized findings with our team.

---

**Objection 3: "How do I know the AI is accurate?"**

**Response Copy:**
> Prescriptiv isn't experimental AI—it's built on established fault detection algorithms validated against industry standards. The same logic ASHRAE has documented for decades, now automated.
>
> But here's the real answer: Try it free and check the results against what you already know about your building. If Prescriptiv finds the issues you're already aware of, imagine what else it's catching that you don't know about yet.

---

**Objection 4: "My data format won't work with your system."**

**Response Copy:**
> If your BAS can export to CSV—and they all can—OnPoint can read it.
>
> Our guided mapping interface handles any naming convention. We don't care if you call it "AHU-1-SAT" or "Building_A_Supply_Air_Temp_1"—our system helps you map it correctly.
>
> Upload a sample file in the free tier and see for yourself using guided onboarding.

---

**Objection 5: "We don't have budget for new software."**

**Response Copy:**
> You don't have budget to NOT know what's broken.
>
> Buildings with undetected faults waste 15-30% on energy costs. On a $100,000 annual energy bill, that's $15,000-30,000 walking out the door every year.
>
> OnPoint's one-time unlock costs less than a single service call. The subscription costs less than monthly landscaping. And unlike landscaping, this pays for itself in the first issue you fix.
>
> Start with the free preview. When you see the faults you're missing, budget finds itself.

---

**Objection 6: "I need to get approval from [leadership/IT/procurement]."**

**Response Copy:**
> Perfect. Here's how to make that easy:
>
> 1. Run the free preview yourself with sample BAS data
> 2. Download the sample report showing what we found
> 3. Present to leadership: "I found these issues in our building. Here's what it costs to investigate further."
>
> You're not asking for budget to "try software." You're presenting specific, documented issues with a solution that costs less than the meeting about it.
>
> The free preview is your business case.

---

**Objection 7: "Is our data secure?"**

**Response Copy:**
> Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We never share, sell, or use your building data for anything except your analysis.
>
> Think about it: We're a building technology company. Our business depends on trust. One data breach and we're done. Security isn't a feature—it's our survival.
>
> Full security details on our Security page. Or if you need specific compliance documentation, contact us directly.

---

**Objection 8: "We're too small for this kind of tool."**

**Response Copy:**
> OnPoint was BUILT for organizations like yours.
>
> Enterprise AFDD costs $50,000+ and requires a team to manage. That's designed for portfolios of 100+ buildings with dedicated analytics staff.
>
> OnPoint works for a single building and a single person. No sensors to install, no consultants to hire, no software to learn. If you can export a CSV and follow a guided interface, you can use OnPoint.
>
> Small buildings have the same faults as big ones—they just have smaller budgets to find them. That's exactly our point.

---

**Objection 9: "What's the catch with 'free'?"**

**Response Copy:**
> No catch. We show you value first because we're confident in what we built.
>
> Free gives you a preview: top 5 faults from your data. It's enough to prove OnPoint works, but not enough to fully act on.
>
> When you see what's lurking in your building data, you'll want the full picture. That's when you pay. If you don't see value in the preview, you owe us nothing.
>
> We'd rather earn your business than trick you into it.

---

**Objection 10: "We have an energy consultant who handles this."**

**Response Copy:**
> Great—OnPoint makes them more effective.
>
> Energy audits typically happen once a year and cost $15,000-50,000. Between audits, new issues emerge. Old issues return. Equipment degrades.
>
> OnPoint gives you continuous visibility at a fraction of the cost. Your consultant can focus on implementing fixes instead of spending half their time finding problems.
>
> Better yet: Run OnPoint before your next audit. Hand your consultant a prioritized fault list. Watch how fast that audit goes.
