## 4. Voice & Tone Guidelines for Building Owners

### Writing for Non-Technical Executives

**Do:**
- Lead with outcomes, not features
- Use financial language (ROI, savings, budget, costs)
- Speak to their goals (efficiency, sustainability, compliance)
- Respect their time - be concise
- Use confident, direct statements

**Don't:**
- Lead with technical specifications
- Assume they know HVAC terminology
- Use jargon without explanation
- Bury the value proposition
- Sound salesy or desperate

### ROI-Focused Language Patterns

**Instead of This:** | **Write This:**
--------------------|----------------
"Our AI analyzes your data" | "Find the faults draining your budget"
"Advanced fault detection algorithms" | "See exactly where you're losing money"
"Automated diagnostic capabilities" | "Know what to fix first for maximum impact"
"Cloud-based analytics platform" | "Get answers without IT involvement"
"Machine learning engine" | "Prescriptiv AI identifies your biggest opportunities"

### Confidence Without Arrogance

**Confident (Good):**
- "OnPoint finds faults other methods miss"
- "Our customers receive prioritized findings with clear next steps"
- "Built specifically for facilities teams"
- "We focus on what matters: getting you answers"

**Arrogant (Avoid):**
- "The only solution that actually works"
- "Everyone else is doing it wrong"
- "Obviously the best choice"
- "You'd be foolish not to..."

**Weak (Avoid):**
- "We think we can help"
- "Hopefully you'll see results"
- "We try to find faults"
- "Our solution might work for you"

### Tone Calibration by Context

| Context | Tone |
|---------|------|
| Homepage hero | Bold, outcome-focused, confident |
| Feature pages | Clear, specific, benefit-driven |
| Pricing page | Transparent, value-focused, straightforward |
| Case studies | Evidence-based, specific, credible |
| Industry pages | Knowledgeable, empathetic, specialized |
| Support/FAQ | Helpful, clear, patient |

### Executive Summary Style
When writing for building owners and investors, structure content as:

1. **The Problem** (their pain point, in their language)
2. **The Cost** (what it's costing them now)
3. **The Solution** (what OnPoint does - one sentence)
4. **The Outcome** (specific benefit they care about)
5. **The Proof** (credibility marker)
6. **The Action** (clear next step)

## Quick Reference Card

### The 5-Second Check
Before any copy goes live, ask:

1. **Is it allowed?** (Check Section 1)
2. **Is it forbidden?** (Check Section 2)
3. **Does it need a disclaimer?** (Check Section 3)
4. **Is it right for our audience?** (Check Section 4)
5. **Is it appropriate for this industry?** (Check Section 5)

### Red Flag Words - Stop and Check
If you see these words, verify they're used correctly:

| Word | Action |
|------|--------|
| "Save" | Needs disclaimer if specific percentage |
| "Guarantee" | Probably not allowed |
| "Always" / "Never" | Probably not allowed |
| "Best" / "Leading" | Probably not allowed |
| "Patent" | Not allowed |
| "BIM" / "3D" | Not allowed |
| "Rebuilt" / "Previous" | Not allowed |
| "AI" (generic) | Use "Prescriptiv AI" instead |

### The Golden Rules

**Rule 1: If you can't prove it, don't claim it.**

**Rule 2: If you can prove it, say it simply.**

**Rule 3: Write for the building owner, not the engineer.**

**Rule 4: When in doubt, leave it out.**
