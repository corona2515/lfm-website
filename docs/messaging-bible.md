# LeanFM Messaging Bible
## StoryBrand Framework for Building Owners & Investors

*Last Updated: February 17, 2026*
*Target Audience: Building Owners, Investors, Real Estate Decision-Makers*

---

## Rollout Status (Current)

- Do not use time-based promises (for example, "under an hour" or "results in minutes") while stress testing and scaling.
- Primary conversion path: submit lead form.
- Secondary path: create account and upload sample BAS data.
- Use risk-reversal language: no long-term contract required to start.

---

## One-Liner

**Most building owners are losing thousands to hidden HVAC faults they cannot see. OnPoint turns BAS data into a prioritized action plan so teams know exactly what to fix first and where savings may exist.**

*Alternative versions:*
- "OnPoint turns your building data into a prioritized action plan—find hidden faults, fix what matters most, and save up to 30% on energy costs."
- "Stop losing money to invisible HVAC problems. OnPoint finds the faults draining your budget and tells you exactly what to fix."

---

## StoryBrand Framework

### 1. Character (The Hero): Building Owner/Investor

**Who they are:**
- Building owners, real estate investors, portfolio managers
- Managing 1-50 buildings (sweet spot: 3-15 properties)
- Industries: K-12 school districts, museums, small colleges/universities
- Budget-conscious but willing to invest in proven ROI

**Their worldview:**
- "Every dollar matters—I need to see clear returns on any investment"
- "I'm not technical, and I don't have time to become one"
- "I've been burned by expensive software that promised more than it delivered"
- "My buildings should be assets, not money pits"
- "I trust data, but I need someone to translate it into action"

**What they want:**
- Lower operating costs without major capital investments
- Clear, simple answers—not dashboards to decipher
- Proof they can show their board, investors, or stakeholders
- To feel confident they're not leaving money on the table
- A trusted partner, not another vendor

**Their typical day:**
- Juggling multiple properties and priorities
- Getting surprised by unexpected maintenance costs
- Hearing complaints about comfort from tenants/occupants
- Reviewing budgets and looking for savings
- Trying to make sense of utility bills that keep climbing

---

### 2. The Problem

#### External Problem (The Visible Issue)
Your buildings have hidden HVAC faults that are wasting energy and money every single day—but your current systems can't find them. Traditional fault detection tools cost $50,000+ and take months to deploy. You know there's waste, but you can't see it.

**Symptoms they experience:**
- Utility bills that keep rising without explanation
- Equipment failing earlier than expected
- Tenant comfort complaints they can't resolve
- BAS data they can't interpret
- No clear maintenance priorities

#### Internal Problem (How It Makes Them FEEL)
"I feel like I'm flying blind with my building operations. I know I'm probably losing money somewhere, but I can't prove it or find it. It's embarrassing when my board asks about energy efficiency and I don't have real answers. I'm frustrated because I've invested in building systems that were supposed to help, but I still can't see what's actually happening."

**Emotional states:**
- **Frustrated** — "I have all this data but no insights"
- **Anxious** — "What problems am I missing that will cost me later?"
- **Embarrassed** — "I should know what's happening in my own buildings"
- **Overwhelmed** — "I don't have time to become a building systems expert"
- **Skeptical** — "I've heard big promises from tech vendors before"

#### Philosophical Problem (Why This is WRONG)
Building owners shouldn't need a PhD or a six-figure budget to understand what's happening in their own buildings. Your building data should work for you—not sit unused while money leaks out the door. In 2026, there's no excuse for invisible waste.

**The deeper truth:**
- You deserve clarity about your own assets
- Technology should simplify decisions, not complicate them
- Small and mid-size building owners deserve the same insights as Fortune 500 companies
- Proactive building management should be accessible to everyone

---

### 3. The Guide: LeanFM Technologies

#### Empathy (We Understand)
We know what it's like to stare at a utility bill and wonder where the money went. We've talked to hundreds of building owners who felt trapped—too small for enterprise solutions, too sophisticated for "just check the filters" advice. You're not alone, and this problem isn't your fault. Building systems were designed to control equipment, not to tell you what's wrong.

**We hear you saying:**
- "I just need someone to tell me what to fix"
- "I can't justify a $50K software investment"
- "I don't have 6 months to wait for answers"
- "Show me the ROI before I commit"

#### Authority (We Can Help)
LeanFM was founded in 2015 by CMU PhDs who spent years researching how buildings actually work. Our founder, Pine Liu, was recognized as an IFMA Forty Under 40 for leadership in facility management innovation.

**Proof points:**
- Founded by Carnegie Mellon University PhDs with deep building science expertise
- IFMA Forty Under 40 Award recipient (Pine Liu, Founder)
- Serving K-12 school districts, museums, and higher education institutions
- Prescriptiv AI engine analyzes BAS data and prioritizes findings by impact
- Customers report savings of up to 30% on energy costs
- Pittsburgh-based team with over a decade of building analytics experience

**What makes us different:**
- AI-first approach: Prescriptiv doesn't just detect faults—it prioritizes them by impact
- Guided rollout: Stress-tested onboarding with clear status updates
- Accessible pricing: A fraction of the cost of enterprise AFDD solutions
- No complexity: Upload your data, get answers—no training required

---

### 4. The Plan (3 Simple Steps)

**Step 1: Start Your Onboarding Path**
Submit a lead form for guided onboarding, or create an account and start in the app.

**Step 2: Upload BAS Sample Data**
Upload your BAS CSV export or use the sample template placeholder to confirm format.

Receive a clear list of prioritized issues with recommended next actions as onboarding progresses.

*Process timing varies based on onboarding volume and data quality.*

### 6. Success (The Transformation)

#### Before OnPoint
- Flying blind on building performance
- Surprised by equipment failures and high utility bills
- Can't justify investments to stakeholders
- Reactive maintenance mode
- Data from BAS sits unused
- Feeling anxious about what you might be missing
- Embarrassed when asked about energy efficiency

#### After OnPoint
- Crystal clear visibility into every fault
- Prioritized action list—know exactly what to fix first
- Confident ROI conversations with boards and investors
- Proactive maintenance that prevents failures
- Building data finally working for you
- Peace of mind knowing nothing is hiding
- Proud to show real results and savings

**Customer transformation statements:**
- "I finally know what's actually happening in my buildings"
- "We found $40,000 in annual savings we didn't know existed"
- "I can show my board exactly where our money is going"
- "We went from reactive to proactive in one month"
- "For the first time, I trust my building data"

---

### 7. Failure (The Stakes)

**If you don't act, here's what continues:**

#### Financial Stakes
- Continued energy waste: 15-30% of your energy budget, every month
- Premature equipment failure: Emergency replacements cost 3-5x planned upgrades
- Missed savings: Every month without insight is money you'll never recover
- Budget surprises: Utility spikes that blow your projections

#### Operational Stakes
- Reactive maintenance chaos: Always fighting fires, never getting ahead
- Tenant/occupant complaints: Comfort issues that damage your reputation
- Staff burnout: Teams stretched thin chasing problems they can't see
- Compliance risks: Energy mandates and reporting requirements increasing

#### Strategic Stakes
- Competitive disadvantage: Other owners are already optimizing
- Missed ESG goals: Sustainability commitments you can't meet
- Asset devaluation: Inefficient buildings are worth less
- Lost credibility: Stakeholders lose confidence in your management

**The hard truth:**
Every day you wait, hidden faults are costing you money. The problems don't fix themselves—they compound. A fault that costs $500/month today becomes a $15,000 equipment replacement next year.

- Industry fit (K-12, museums, higher ed)
- Process (upload, analyze, get results)
- Proof point (customer quote or savings example)
- Clear CTA (free analysis or demo)
